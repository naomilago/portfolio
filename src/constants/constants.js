    title: 'Healthier',
    description: "Healthier is also a very special project because I could deal with UX/UI Design, which is another thing I love. It consists of an application that helps you find better ways to have healthy meals, good recipes and tips for living a healthier life. When I came up with this idea I got so excited and I had a good time designing it. PS.: Healthier is still a prototype until now. Feel free to develop the application as you want, as long as you keep it free and open-source ðŸ˜Š",
